# MoonForge Smart Contract - Future Development Plans

## 🎯 Essential Missing Functions

### **1. `refundUnused(campaignId)` - CRITICAL PRIORITY**
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**Why needed:** Brands need to get back their unused tokens after campaigns end.

```solidity
function refundUnused(uint256 campaignId) external {
    Campaign storage campaign = campaigns[campaignId];
    
    // Validation checks
    require(campaign.id != 0, "Campaign does not exist");
    require(msg.sender == campaign.brand, "Only brand can refund");
    require(campaign.merkleRoot != bytes32(0), "Results not published yet");
    require(!campaign.isActive, "Campaign still active");
    
    // Calculate unused amount
    uint256 unusedAmount = campaign.budget - campaign.totalAllocated;
    require(unusedAmount > 0, "No unused funds to refund");
    
    // Mark as refunded to prevent double refunds
    campaign.totalAllocated = campaign.budget;
    
    // Transfer unused tokens back to brand
    IERC20(campaign.rewardToken).transfer(campaign.brand, unusedAmount);
    
    emit FundsRefunded(campaignId, campaign.brand, unusedAmount, block.timestamp);
}
```

### **2. `fundCampaign(campaignId, amount)` - Important for UX**
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**Why needed:** Brands might want to add more budget to successful campaigns.

```solidity
function fundCampaign(uint256 campaignId, uint256 amount) external {
    Campaign storage campaign = campaigns[campaignId];
    
    // Validation checks
    require(campaign.id != 0, "Campaign does not exist");
    require(msg.sender == campaign.brand, "Only brand can fund their campaign");
    require(campaign.isActive, "Campaign is not active");
    require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");
    require(campaign.merkleRoot == bytes32(0), "Cannot fund after results published");
    
    // Update campaign budget
    campaign.budget += amount;
    
    // Transfer additional tokens to contract
    IERC20(campaign.rewardToken).transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    
    emit CampaignFunded(campaignId, msg.sender, amount, block.timestamp);
}
```

### **3. Emergency Functions - Security**
**Status:** Not Implemented  
**Why needed:** Contract safety and recovery mechanisms.

```solidity
// Emergency pause functionality
bool public contractPaused = false;

modifier whenNotPaused() {
    require(!contractPaused, "Contract is paused");
    _;
}

function pauseContract() external onlyOwner {
    contractPaused = true;
    emit ContractPaused(block.timestamp);
}

function unpauseContract() external onlyOwner {
    contractPaused = false;
    emit ContractUnpaused(block.timestamp);
}

function emergencyWithdraw(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner {
    // Only in extreme emergencies - requires multi-sig in production
    require(contractPaused, "Can only emergency withdraw when paused");
    IERC20(token).transfer(owner, amount);
    emit EmergencyWithdraw(token, amount, block.timestamp);
}
```

## 🚀 Hackathon-Specific Functions

### **4. Uniswap Integration Functions - FOR THE HACKATHON**
**Status:** High Priority  
**Why needed:** This is your Uniswap value proposition!

```solidity
function convertMoonToETH(uint256 campaignId, uint256 moonAmount) external whenNotPaused {
    // Automatic conversion of MOON rewards to ETH via Uniswap V4
    // This demonstrates direct Uniswap integration value
    
    Campaign storage campaign = campaigns[campaignId];
    require(campaign.rewardToken == MOON_TOKEN_ADDRESS, "Only MOON tokens can be converted");
    
    // Use Uniswap V4 to swap MOON -> ETH
    // Implementation depends on Uniswap V4 API
}

function claimAndConvert(
    uint256 campaignId, 
    uint256 amount, 
    bytes32[] calldata proof
) external whenNotPaused {
    // Claim MOON tokens and automatically convert to ETH
    // One-click user experience - this is the killer feature!
    
    // First claim the MOON tokens (reuse existing logic)
    claimReward(campaignId, amount, proof);
    
    // Then automatically convert to ETH via Uniswap
    convertMoonToETH(campaignId, amount);
}
```

### **5. Campaign Analytics - For Demo**
**Status:** Nice to Have  
**Why needed:** Show campaign performance metrics for brands.

```solidity
function getCampaignMetrics(uint256 campaignId) 
    external 
    view 
    returns (
        uint256 participantCount,
        uint256 claimRate,
        uint256 averageReward,
        uint256 totalUniswapVolume
    ) 
{
    Campaign storage campaign = campaigns[campaignId];
    require(campaign.id != 0, "Campaign does not exist");
    
    // Calculate metrics from events and state
    // This would require additional tracking variables
    
    return (
        participantCount,
        (campaign.totalAllocated * 100) / campaign.budget, // claimRate as percentage
        campaign.totalAllocated / participantCount, // averageReward
        totalUniswapVolume // Track volume generated through conversions
    );
}
```

## 📊 Implementation Priority

### **Must Implement (Next 24 hours):**
1. ✅ **`refundUnused`** - Brands NEED this for complete campaign lifecycle
2. ✅ **Basic Uniswap integration** - For the hackathon prize and demo

### **Should Implement (Day 2):**
3. ✅ **`fundCampaign`** - Better UX for brands, shows platform flexibility
4. ✅ **One emergency function** - Shows you understand security best practices

### **Nice to Have (If Time):**
5. 🎯 **Analytics functions** - Great for demo, shows data-driven approach
6. 🎯 **Batch operations** - Process multiple claims efficiently
7. 🎯 **Campaign templates** - Pre-configured campaign types

### **Skip for Hackathon:**
- ❌ Complex governance features
- ❌ Multi-sig functionality  
- ❌ Detailed access control beyond oracle
- ❌ Cross-chain functionality

---

## 🎯 Hackathon Success Strategy

**Focus on these 2 additional functions for maximum impact:**

1. **`refundUnused`** - Essential functionality that completes the campaign lifecycle
2. **`claimAndConvert`** - Your Uniswap V4 integration showcase

This combination gives you:
- ✅ Complete campaign lifecycle (create → run → claim → refund)
- ✅ Clear Uniswap value proposition (seamless MOON → ETH conversion)
- ✅ Working demo with real use case
- ✅ Security basics covered
- ✅ Differentiation from other projects

## 🔄 Future Enhancements (Post-Hackathon)

### **Phase 2: Advanced Features**
- Multi-token support for campaigns
- Campaign scheduling and automation
- Advanced fraud detection
- Integration with more DEXs beyond Uniswap

### **Phase 3: Scale & Production**
- Gas optimization
- Layer 2 deployment (Arbitrum, Polygon)
- Enhanced security audits
- Governance token launch

### **Phase 4: Ecosystem Expansion**
- Brand dashboard and analytics platform
- Mobile app integration
- API for third-party integrations
- Cross-chain campaign support

event ContractPaused(uint256 timestamp);
event ContractUnpaused(uint256 timestamp);
event EmergencyWithdraw(address indexed token, uint256 amount, uint256 timestamp);
event MoonConverted(uint256 indexed campaignId, address indexed user, uint256 moonAmount, uint256 ethReceived, uint256 timestamp);
